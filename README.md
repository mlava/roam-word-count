This extension allows you to calculate the word count for any page or block selection.

NEW:
- added support for multiselect contect menu (right-click, Plugins, Word Count (selected blocks))
- added support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean ideographs. Thanks [@aka-phrankie](https://github.com/aka-phrankie)
- now compatible with the new user-defined hotkeys function - see Hotkeys option in Roam Research Settings

Trigger via the Command Palette and a toast with the word count will be created. Or, right-click on a block bullet and select Plugins > Word Count (selected block(s) only).

To get the word count for a selected area of text, use the Roam Research multi-block select (CTRL-m) and then select the blocks to include. Then trigger this extension using any keyboard shortcut you configure via Settings > Hotkeys, or via the block bullet context menu or the Command Palette.
