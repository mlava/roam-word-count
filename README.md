This extension allows you to calculate the word count for any page or text selection. 

You can trigger via the Command Palette and a toast with the word count will be created. To get the word count for a selected area of text, select your text and then trigger using the keyboard shortcut SHIFT-ALT-q.

You can't get the word count for selection using the Command Palette option as the selection is removed when loading the Command Palette.
